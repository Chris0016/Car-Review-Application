** Important **
 		 
 		
 		Once a user logs in successfully, the account object in LogInController will be updated to the user that just logged in. 
 		The UserReviewsController class keeps a reference to this variable to retrieve the appropriate table based on the userId. 
 		
 		The fact that different classes can keep a reference to this single variable that gets updated is very important. Otherwise, each class would need to 
 		have the username and password and make a connection to be database upon initializing to retrieve the user data. This would be a security concern but also
 		more result in being more costly to the program in terms of speed.

 Section 0.1
 
 	 ** Important **
	
	 The HomePaneMasterClass should only be used for scenes that will need a main gridPane ONLY. This is due to some issues with the flow. What is meant by flow is the order in which
	 elements get initialized. Constructor and any calls to super within the constructor -> SuperClass Constructor -> FXML vars -> initialize(). ITS COMPLICATED. 
 	
 	As long as the right number of columns is set in the fxml gridpane and the right number of columns is passed to the super class the program will be able to adapt. 
 	However, once set, in order to get rid of a column the class must implement a method to delete the column.(The subclass has access to the gridPane fxml var). Then run refresh().

What it does:
This application is meant to be a car review application where users can see a list of car reviews
for a given set of cars. Further, users can add or delete their reviews to the system. The system
will dynamically update when users hit refresh and will show the new average of car reviews per car. 

How it works:

There are several FXML files that are responsible for rendering the design of every scene. 
The buttons and back-end, such as buttons and text change, is controlled by special classes that
follow the format '<SomeName>Controller.java'. 

The overall architecture goes as follows:
