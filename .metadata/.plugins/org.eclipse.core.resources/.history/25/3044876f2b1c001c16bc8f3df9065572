/* 
 	Why:
 		All of the information retrieved from the resultset on log-in is related to each other and belongs together. 
 		Represents user data as one type instead of discrete variables. 
 		
 		
 		** Important **
 		Used by the "My reviews section" to retrieve table of user reviews. 
 		
 		Once a user logs in successfully, the account object in LogInController will be updated to the user that just logged in. 
 		The UserReviewsController class keeps a reference to this variable to retrieve the appropriate table based on the userId. 
 		
 		The fact that different classes can keep a reference to this single variable that gets updated is very important. Otherwise, each class would need to 
 		have the username and password and make a connection to be database upon initializing to retrieve the user data. This would be a security concern but also
 		more result in being more costly to the program in terms of speed.
